<h3>Hi! I'm kajmeter. <h4>An IT worker with self taught / incomplete academic programming background.<br>
<br>
I'm currently interested in bringing computer vision and photogrammetry to Java using lightweight models.
  <br>
I also maintain my Assetto Corsa game servers, have a look :) http://actd.pl/
